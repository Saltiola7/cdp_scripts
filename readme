# Python CDP
Collection of customer data platform scripts that Im eventually packaging into a CLI. Specifically the scripts are for automating SEO can cold outreach database tasks.

The current state is disorganized and waiting for proper refactoring, but there are some standalone scripts that can be useful for technical marketeers in their SEO and cold outreach.

Im constantly updating this as it is my intention to build a fully functional Customer Data Platform

## The current tech stack where Im focusing on
- python
- clickhouse SQL
- zsh
- Google Sheets (Gspread, AppScripts)
### Tech that Im testing
- Mojo
- Go
- Elixir

### Recommended IDEs
- VSCode
- VSCodium
- Cursor.sh

## Recommended VSCode extensions
- Foam
- Markdown All in One
- Data Wrangler
- SQL Tools
- YAML
- Postman
- Jupyter
- Pylance

# Roadmap
- Refactoring the codebase
  - Making the scripts more coherent and unified
- Command line interface so these tools can be called from cli
- Integration with Windmill.dev to make these scripts available through automatically generated UI in a similar fashion as Retool (maybe)
